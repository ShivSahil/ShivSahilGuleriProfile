Born in MÃ³stoles and raised in Toledo, Spain. I am an assistant professor at University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain) from February 2021.

My research interests are computational electromagnetics and antenna measurements. My Ph.D. dissertation included the development and implementation of techniques (e.g. domain decomposition methods) to develop a finite element code with hp adaptivity and different element shapes.

As a teaching assistant, I have imparted more than 400 teaching hours in different Telecommunication bachelor and master degrees in the last 8 years. As a researcher, I am part of 10 indexed papers and 26 conference papers. I have been a visiting scholar at The Ohio State University hosted by Prof. Jin-Fa Lee for seven months, and at the University of Macau for two months. I was a postdoctoral researcher at Saarland University from 2019 to 2020 with Prof. Dyczij-Edlinger.
